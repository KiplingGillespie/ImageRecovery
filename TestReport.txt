Test Plan:
	For this project, our team decided to use a mix of automated testing as well
as visual subjective testing. Automated testing allows us to quickly and 
efficiently test certain modules of our project. This is accomplished using
Python's unittest library.
	Visual testing is necessary because of the very nature of our product.
Unfortunatley, this cannot be automated and can differ from person to person.
However, as a group we can collectively refine our approval of the test by
comming to consensus we can all agree upon.
	Some modules (i.e. ImageRestoreTool) do produce output but do not return any
values. For these tests, we manually go through various types of input and see
if we get our expected output.

Automated Unit Test Example #1:
	Team 9:test$ python3 -m unittest TestFileIO.py
	..
	----------------------------------------------------------------------
	Ran 2 tests in 0.001s

	OK

Automated Unit Test Example #2:
	Team 9:test$ python3 -m unittest TestCommentCounter.py
	..
	----------------------------------------------------------------------
	Ran 2 tests in 0.002s

	OK

Subjective Visual Testing:
	So far, the output image of our tests do not meet the standards we require 
for our product.

Future testing:
	- Expand tests as the rest of our project expands
	- Add support for quantitative image comparison testing
	- Add additional testing for existing modules
